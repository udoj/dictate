## üöÄ Getting Started                                                                                 

### Console Application
```bash
python dictate_console.py
```
Press ENTER to start recording, and ENTER again to stop. Your transcript will be displayed and saved automatically with a summary of its key words.

### Desktop Interface
```bash
python dictate_gui.py
```
Use the intuitive interface to record, stop, and copy your transcriptions. Monitor your audio levels in real-time through the visual meter.

Transcripts are automatically saved as `transcript_[timestamp]_[keywords].txt`, where keywords are the three most common meaningful words from your recording (e.g., `transcript_20240215_meeting_project_review.txt`).

## Notes

- If PyAudio fails to install, grab a wheel from Gohlke's site.
- Ensure your mic is the default input device in your OS settings.
- To silence the FP16 warning:
  ```python
  import warnings
  warnings.filterwarnings(
      "ignore",
      message="FP16 is not supported on CPU; using FP32 instead"
  )
  ```
- Do not name your script `whisper.py`‚Äîit will clash with the library.
