# Whisper Recorder

Two Python scripts to record and transcribe audio using OpenAI Whisper.

## Installation

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. **Create & activate** a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install ffmpeg** as an administrator (required by Whisper):
   ```bash
   choco install ffmpeg --yes
   ```
   Or download from ffmpeg.org and add its bin folder to your PATH.

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Scripts

### 1. Console Version

Run:
```bash
python whisper_console.py
```

Press ENTER to start recording, and ENTER again to stop.

The transcript is printed and saved to a `transcript_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_summary.txt` file.

### 2. GUI Version

Run:
```bash
python whisper_gui.py
```

Click **Record** to start, **Stop** to end.

The transcript appears in the window, automatically saved to a file.

Click **Copy** to copy it to your clipboard.

## Notes

- If PyAudio fails to install, grab a wheel from Gohlke's site.
- Ensure your mic is the default input device in your OS settings.
- To silence the FP16 warning:
  ```python
  import warnings
  warnings.filterwarnings(
      "ignore",
      message="FP16 is not supported on CPU; using FP32 instead"
  )
  ```
- Do not name your script `whisper.py`â€”it will clash with the library.
